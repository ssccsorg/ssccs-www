# Diagnosis Report: Technical Assessment & Strategic Roadmap
SSCCS Foundation
2026-03-25

## Executive Summary

As a Global Open‑Source Initiative, SSCCS is a genuinely bold,
foundational innovation—the kind of transformative, high-risk research
and the philosophical depth and structural novelty are core strengths.
However, the current documentation is written as a foundational fact
report rather than as a comprehensive project whitepaper. To guide the
next phase of development—whether seeking international research
funding, building a global consortium, or establishing an open‑source
ecosystem—the project must bridge the gap between “paradigm‑shifting
theory” and “testable, benchmarked, verifiable breakthrough.”

This document provides a self-assessment and strategic roadmap for
SSCCS. It draws inspiration from the rigorous evaluation criteria of
programmes like the [EIC
Pathfinder’s](https://luxinnovation.lu/news/horizon-europe%E2%80%99s-eic-in-2026-turn-breakthrough-ideas-into-market-success)
to identify gaps and prescribe actionable improvements, but it is
fundamentally a project‑internal planning tool—one that reflects the
global, open‑source nature of SSCCS and its ambition to be adopted
across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and beyond.

The roadmap:

- Articulates the bold scientific unknowns and breakthrough hypothesis.
- Provides a quantified state‑of‑the‑art comparison and benchmarking
  strategy.
- Defines tangible proof‑of‑principle demonstrations with measurable
  KPIs.
- Lays out a three‑track implementation roadmap (Field Synthesis,
  Hardware Mapping, Compiler Optimisations) with milestones and
  deliverables.
- Identifies critical gaps in the current project documentation and
  prescribes specific actions to close them.
- Outlines team structure, global consortium building, governance,
  capital efficiency, and global impact.

By following this plan, SSCCS will transform from a philosophical
whitepaper into a testable, benchmarked, and commercially‑plausible
research programme—while building a genuinely global coalition for
next‑generation computing.

## 1. Current State and Baseline

### 1.1 Whitepaper Foundation (Conceptual Layer)

The whitepaper (`docs/whitepaper/whitepaper.qmd`) defines the SSCCS
ontology:

- Segment: immutable coordinate point with cryptographic identity
  (BLAKE3 hash).
- Scheme: immutable structural blueprint (axes, relations, memory
  layout, observation rules).
- Field: mutable container of dynamic constraints and transition
  matrices.
- Observation: the sole active event that collapses admissible
  configurations into a projection.
- Projection: ephemeral result revealed, not stored.

The paper includes a formal energy model, a compiler‑pipeline
description, and an open‑format specification (`.ss` binary format). It
is written in Quarto, rendered to PDF/HTML, and signed with C2PA for
provenance.

Gaps identified:

- Lack of detailed mathematical formalism for Field composition and
  composition protocols.
- Under‑specified axis types, structural relations, memory‑layout
  abstraction, and observation rules.
- Missing discussion of how the PoC implementation realises the abstract
  concepts.

### 1.2 Proof‑of‑Concept Implementation (Software Layer)

The Rust PoC (`poc/`) validates the core concepts:

- Core crate (`ssccs‑core`): `Segment`, `SpaceCoordinates`,
  `Constraint`, `Field`, `TransitionMatrix`, `Projector` trait,
  observation functions.
- Primitive crate (`ssccs‑primitive`): scheme abstraction layer (axis
  types, structural relations, memory‑layout taxonomy), projector
  implementations (integer, arithmetic, parity), compiler‑pipeline
  skeleton, `.ss` parser stub, Boolean and Integer spaces.
- Ten constitutional tests (`main.rs`) that pass, confirming the model’s
  internal consistency.
- Workspace structure with three placeholder research crates
  (`field‑synthesis`, `hardware‑mapping`, `compiler‑opt`) ready for
  expansion.

Current TRL: 3–4 (experimental proof of concept in laboratory
environment).

### 1.3 Research Notes (Exploratory Layer)

Informal explorations (`docs/research/`) cover:

- Potential synergies with Keccak sponge functions and memristor‑based
  hardware.
- Structural compilation and immutable coordinate spaces.
- Scheme abstraction layer details.
- Open formats directly into machine code.

### 1.4 Initial Impact Articulation

The preliminary impact framing outlines the market need:

- Data movement consumes 60–80% of energy in modern AI accelerators.
- AI‑related incident damages exceed \$100 billion.
- Lack of verifiability in critical applications (autonomous vehicles,
  finance, healthcare).

SSCCS is positioned as a public‑interest, open‑source foundation
addressing these problems.

## 2. Project Gap Assessment

To identify areas for improvement, we use a rigorous evaluation
framework (inspired by programmes like the EIC Pathfinder) as a
diagnostic lens. The resulting gaps are common to early‑stage
breakthrough projects, regardless of funding source.

## 3. Bold Scientific Unknowns and Breakthrough Hypothesis

### 3.1 The Core Unknown

Can computation be fully expressed as the observation of immutable
structure under dynamic constraints, eliminating the need for
instruction sequencing and data movement?

Existing approaches treat computation as transformation of state over
time. SSCCS posits that computation is collapse of structured potential
– a fundamentally different ontological stance. The scientific unknown
is whether this stance can be made practically executable while
preserving determinism, energy efficiency, and scalability.

### 3.2 Convergence of Enabling Technologies: Why Now?

SSCCS is not a speculative idea out of time; it emerges from the
convergence of three recent technological and scientific trends that
make its realisation feasible for the first time.

1.  The End of Dennard Scaling and the Data Movement Crisis  
    For decades, performance scaled with transistor density. Today,
    energy per bit moved has become the dominant constraint. Data
    movement accounts for 60–80% of total energy in modern accelerators.
    Traditional architectures (even PIM) still move data *between*
    computational domains. SSCCS eliminates data movement entirely by
    making data stationary and computation a function of structural
    observation. This is no longer a theoretical advantage—it is an
    economic and physical necessity.

2.  Maturity of Open‑Source Hardware Ecosystems  
    The rise of RISC‑V, open FPGA toolchains (Yosys, nextpnr), and open
    ASIC design flows (OpenLANE, Skywater 130 nm) has drastically
    lowered the barrier to implementing custom compute models. A new ISA
    based on `Observation` can now be prototyped on commodity FPGA
    boards and, if successful, transitioned to silicon without requiring
    a multi‑billion‑dollar semiconductor company. This enables an agile,
    open‑source development model.

3.  Advances in Formal Methods and Verification  
    Over the past five years, proof assistants like Coq and Lean have
    matured to the point where they can handle complex, real‑world
    system verification. The SSCCS model’s determinism and race‑freedom
    are precisely the kind of properties that can now be mechanised.
    This allows us to build, from the ground up, a computing system with
    provable safety guarantees—a feature absent from conventional
    architectures.

### 3.3 Specific Unknowns to Investigate

1.  Field composition algebra – How can multiple Fields be combined
    while preserving observation determinism?
2.  Hardware mapping of structural constraints – Can a Scheme’s
    memory‑layout abstraction be compiled directly into hardware
    topologies with provable data‑movement reduction?
3.  Observation‑centric hardware – Can a physical device be designed
    where the “observation” event corresponds to a measurable energy
    pulse?
4.  Formal verification of collapse determinism – Under what conditions
    does an observation produce a unique projection?
5.  Open‑format to machine‑code compilation – Can the `.ss` binary
    format be compiled directly into machine code bypassing traditional
    instruction selection?

### 3.4 Why Existing Approaches Cannot Deliver This Breakthrough

| Approach | Limitation | Why Incremental Improvements Fail |
|----|----|----|
| Von Neumann | Instruction streams bound to data movement | PIM, CXL, HBM reduce *distance* but still move data between domains |
| Dataflow/Systolic | Tokens move through static graph | SSCCS eliminates token movement entirely |
| PIM/CXL/HBM | Within von Neumann paradigm | Even if off‑chip movement eliminated, on‑chip movement and control overhead remain |
| Neuromorphic | Specialised for spike‑based processing | Lacks general‑purpose determinism |
| Quantum | Programming model remains instruction‑based | SSCCS offers classical deterministic alternative |

The fundamental argument: Energy per operation is not the limiting
factor; energy *per bit moved* is. SSCCS eliminates the “per bit moved”
term entirely by making data stationary and computation a function of
structural observation.

## 4. Quantified Advantages and Benchmarking Strategy

### 4.1 State‑of‑the‑Art Benchmarking Table

| Alternative | Key characteristic | Data Movement Cost | Parallelism Model | Verifiability | SSCCS Advantage |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Von Neumann CPUs/GPUs | Sequential instruction execution | High (off‑chip) | SIMD | Low | Data stationary; no movement |
| Dataflow architectures | Tokens flow through static graph | Medium (on‑chip) | Explicit graph | Medium | Zero token movement |
| Processing‑in‑Memory (PIM) | Compute near memory banks | Low (in‑bank) | Near‑memory | Low | Scheme structure maps directly |
| FPGA overlays | Reconfigurable logic blocks | Medium (config load) | Spatial | Medium | Config as Field; dynamic re‑observation |
| Quantum annealers | Quantum tunneling for optimisation | N/A | Quantum | Low | General‑purpose and deterministic |

### 4.2 Benchmarking Methodology and Projected Gains

To ensure scientific rigour, we define a clear methodology and provide a
*range* of projected gains based on theoretical ceilings, not
speculative promises.

Baseline Selection

- Primary baseline: A standard RISC‑V core (e.g., CVA6) synthesised on
  the *same* FPGA as the SSCCS prototype. This isolates the
  architectural advantage from process technology differences.
- Secondary baselines: NVIDIA GPU (Ampere or newer) and a PIM‑capable
  FPGA (e.g., Xilinx VU37P with HBM) for reference.

Kernels

- Vector addition (memory‑bound)
- 2D convolution (compute‑ and data‑bound)
- Graph BFS (pointer‑chasing / irregular)
- Matrix multiplication (compute‑dense)

Measurement Methodology

- Energy: On‑board power monitors (e.g., INA260) measure real‑time power
  draw of the FPGA fabric. Dynamic power will be isolated by subtracting
  idle power.
- Performance: Cycle‑accurate simulation (Verilator) for early
  estimates; final measurements from physical FPGA execution.

Projected Energy Advantage (Range with Justification)

- Upper bound (10× reduction): In small kernels where instruction fetch
  and data movement account for ~90% of energy (e.g., vector addition on
  a scalar core), eliminating these stages yields a potential 10×
  reduction.
- Lower bound (2× reduction): In larger, compute‑dominated kernels, the
  observation engine overhead reduces the net gain. This still
  represents a significant improvement over conventional architectures,
  with added benefits in verifiability and concurrency.

*These projections will be validated and refined through the
benchmarking suite (Section 6.4).*

### 4.3 Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline (RISC‑V on FPGA) | Target for SSCCS |
|----|----|----|
| Energy per operation (vector add) | 10 pJ/op (measured) | ≤ 1 pJ/op (10× reduction) |
| Energy per operation (convolution) | 50 pJ/op | ≤ 10 pJ/op (5× reduction) |
| Concurrency (race‑free) | Requires locks | Unlimited parallel observation |
| Verification time (small kernel) | Hours (manual) | Minutes (structural inspection) |

## 5. Tangible Proof‑of‑Principle Definition

Over the next 36 months, we will deliver:

1.  A fully functional SSCCS software stack compiling `.ss` files into
    observation‑centric executables.
2.  An FPGA‑based hardware prototype demonstrating observation‑collapse
    with measurable energy savings.
3.  A formal proof (mechanized in Lean/Coq) of determinism and
    race‑freedom for a subset of the algebra.

Concrete demonstration workloads:

| Workload | Problem Size | Baseline | Expected Advantage |
|----|----|----|----|
| 2D Convolution | 32×32 kernel, 1024×1024 input | PyTorch on CPU/GPU | 10× energy reduction, traceable projection |
| Graph BFS | 1000‑node graph | C++ on CPU | Elimination of pointer‑chasing overhead |
| Matrix Multiplication | 512×512 matrix | cuBLAS on GPU | Data stationary computation |

## 6. Implementation Roadmap per Research Track

### 6.1 Track A: Field Synthesis (`ssccs-field-synthesis`)

Scientific unknown: How can Fields be composed algebraically while
preserving observation determinism?

| Phase | Tasks | Timeline | Deliverables |
|----|----|----|----|
| Algebraic formalisation | Define union, intersection, product operators; prove closure properties; implement in Rust | M1–M6 | Rust crate with unit tests |
| Composition protocols | Define logical and binary composition protocols; implement CompositeScheme builder | M6–M12 | Integration with `.ss` format |
| Integration with PoC | Extend compiler pipeline; update parser; integration tests | M12–M18 | End‑to‑end composition working |

### 6.2 Track B: Hardware Mapping (`ssccs-hardware-mapping`)

Scientific unknown: Can a Scheme’s structural constraints be compiled
directly into hardware topologies that eliminate data movement?

Key innovation – Observation Intermediate Representation (OIR)

To bridge the semantic gap between the high‑level SSCCS model and
hardware, we introduce an Observation Intermediate Representation (OIR)
. OIR is a dataflow graph where:

- Nodes represent `Segment` instances (immutable data blobs).
- Edges represent `Constraint` relations between Segments.
- Observation operators are attached to subgraphs.

The hardware backend (FPGA/ASIC) synthesises OIR directly into:

- Block RAM (BRAM) / HBM mappings for Segments (data stationary).
- Logic cells / look‑up tables for evaluating constraints and performing
  collapse.
- Control logic that triggers observation events without instruction
  fetch.

This approach eliminates the need for a traditional instruction pipeline
and allows the compiler to optimise for data locality at the structural
level.

| Phase | Tasks | Timeline | Deliverables |
|----|----|----|----|
| Memory‑layout enhancement | Extend MemoryLayout for hierarchical, graph‑based layouts | M1–M9 | Enhanced layout engine |
| Hardware‑profile expansion | Add profiles for CPU cache, FPGA BRAM, HBM, PIM | M9–M18 | Hardware‑aware compilation |

| FPGA backend | Develop OIR → Verilog compiler; synthesise on FPGA | M12–M24 | Working FPGA prototype |
| Energy measurement | Integrate power‑sensing libraries; add estimation stubs | M18–M30 | Energy measurement dataset |

### 6.3 Track C: Compiler Optimisations (`ssccs-compiler-opt`)

Scientific unknown: Can the `.ss` binary format be compiled directly
into machine code that respects structural guarantees?

| Phase | Tasks | Timeline | Deliverables |
|----|----|----|----|
| Open‑format specification | Finalise `.ss` binary format; extend parser | M1–M6 | Complete format specification |
| LLVM/MLIR backend | Lower SSCCS IR to MLIR dialects; prototype `.ss` → LLVM IR | M6–M18 | Integration with LLVM ecosystem |
| Observation‑code generation | Generate code for observation operators (Ω); integrate with hardware backend | M18–M30 | `.ss` → x86‑64/RISC‑V compiler |

### 6.4 Cross‑Cutting Activities

## 13. Risk Register

The following table formalises the key risks, their probability and
impact, and our mitigation and contingency strategies. This replaces the
earlier “common pitfalls” section with a structured,
project‑management‑ready approach.

| Risk Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Technical | The Observation model cannot be efficiently mapped to FPGA logic without unacceptable latency (e.g., observation collapse requires global coordination). | Medium | High | Track B includes a “backstop” milestone at M12 to evaluate OIR‑to‑logic mapping efficiency on a small kernel. Early prototyping will identify bottlenecks. | Fallback to a multi‑core CPU emulator for the compiler frontend; pivot hardware focus to a co‑processor model where SSCCS acts as an accelerator for specific data‑parallel workloads rather than a full core replacement. |
| Technical | Formal proof of determinism is more complex than anticipated; the algebra may have unforeseen non‑deterministic corner cases. | Medium | Medium | Scope the mechanized proof to a well‑defined subset: determinism of a single observation on a single Field, and commutativity of concurrent observations on disjoint Segments. Use Coq/Lean with extensive tactic automation. | If the full proof stalls, deliver a verified executable semantics in a proof‑assistant that can be used for testing; continue development with runtime assertion checks for determinism. |
| Personnel | Inability to hire a qualified FPGA/ASIC engineer in the target region (Asia) within the project timeline. | Medium | High | Initiate hiring process in parallel with grant application; leverage academic partners (KAIST, NUS, NTU) for access to talent pools and potential secondees. | Re‑scope WP2 to use high‑level synthesis (HLS) from OIR to Verilog, reducing the need for low‑level RTL expertise; hire a remote contractor from Europe or North America. |
| Consortium | Difficulty coordinating across three continents leads to communication overhead and delays. | Medium | Medium | Strong central governance with a dedicated project manager (WP5). Use agile methodology with daily stand‑ups in overlapping time zones. Annual in‑person plenary meeting rotating across regions. | Introduce a technical steering committee with regional leads empowered to make local decisions; use asynchronous communication tools (GitHub Issues, RFCs) for most technical discussions. |
| Funding | One or more anticipated funding sources (e.g., EIC Pathfinder) are not awarded, creating a funding gap. | Medium | High | Pursue multiple parallel funding applications (Europe, Asia, Middle East) with staggered deadlines. Maintain a lean core team that can operate on minimal funding while bridging. | If European funding is delayed, accelerate engagement with Asian sovereign funds or corporate sponsors (Samsung, TSMC) that have expressed interest in novel compute architectures. |
| Market Adoption | The open‑source ecosystem does not materialise; developers find the SSCCS model too foreign to adopt. | Low | Medium | Invest in developer relations (Section 9.5) and accessible documentation (Guide, Manifesto). Provide language bindings (Python, Rust) and emulation backends for easy experimentation. | If adoption is slow, pivot to a high‑value niche: safety‑critical systems (automotive, aerospace) where verifiability is a non‑negotiable advantage, and work with a single anchor customer to prove value. |

  table + fundamental argument)
- Revised section: “Breakthrough and Expected Outcomes” (success
  criteria, KPI table, TRL progression)
- New section: “Implementation Plan” (work packages, Gantt chart,
  budget, collaborative activities)
- Revised section: “Team” (global consortium structure, partner roles,
  geographic complementarity)
- New section: “Pathway to Innovation and Market” (global TRL roadmap,
  IP strategy, early adopter engagement)
- New section: “Global Portfolio Complementarity” (synergies with
  related initiatives across continents)

## 15. Conclusion

This integrated roadmap merges the technical depth of the SSCCS
implementation plan with a rigorous gap‑filling process, inspired by the
evaluation standards of programmes like the EIC Pathfinder but applied
to the project’s own self‑improvement. While European programmes offer
an excellent entry point, the project is also designed to attract
aggressive investment from Asia (Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan), the
Middle East (UAE, Saudi Arabia), and emerging economies in Latin
America. These regions are actively diversifying into deep tech,
semiconductor design, AI infrastructure, and sovereign computing
capabilities. SSCCS offers a unique opportunity to build a multi‑polar,
open‑source computing foundation that can be adopted anywhere.

By following this plan, SSCCS will transform from a philosophical
whitepaper into a testable, benchmarked, and commercially‑plausible
research programme—while building a genuinely global coalition for
next‑generation computing. The plan provides a complete blueprint for
the project’s next phase, ensuring that SSCCS becomes:

- Bold in its scientific ambition – redefining computation as
  observation of immutable structure.
- Rigorous in its execution – with clear KPIs, benchmarks, and
  milestones.
- Global in its reach – attracting partners and funding from multiple
  continents.
- Resilient in its design – diversified supply chain, regulatory
  optionality, multiple funding streams.
